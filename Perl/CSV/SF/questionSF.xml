		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Because a great number of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, we are unable to provide your report.  Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements fit them well or that neither does. This is normal, but taken to an extreme it can prevent identification of theme prevalence.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Please retake StrengthsFinder with this in mind, and your Signature Themes will be calculated.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Because many of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, a note of caution is warranted: Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements fit them well or that neither does. This is normal, but when it occurs very frequently, it does lead to less confidence in the accuracy of direction indicated by your report.  Please keep this in mind when considering how well you feel your report describes you.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT_SQ">Because many of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, a note of caution is warranted: Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements fit them well or that neither does.

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Many years of research conducted by The Gallup Organization suggest that the most effective people are those who understand their strengths and behaviors.  These people are best able to develop strategies to meet and exceed the demands of their daily lives, their careers, and their families.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">A review of the knowledge and skills you have acquired can provide a basic sense of your abilities, but an awareness and understanding of your natural talents will provide true insight into the core reasons behind your consistent successes.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Your Signature Themes report presents your five most dominant themes of talent, in the rank order revealed by your responses to StrengthsFinder.  Of the 34 themes measured, these are your "top five."</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Your Signature Themes are very important in maximizing the talents that lead to your successes.  By focusing on your Signature Themes, separately and in combination, you can identify your talents, build them into strengths, and enjoy personal and career success through consistent, near-perfect performance.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Since a large number of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, we are unable to provide your report. Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements match them well or that neither does. This is normal, but taken to an extreme, it can prevent identification of theme prevalence.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Please re-take StrengthsFinder with this in mind, and your Signature Themes will be calculated.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Since many of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, a note of caution is warranted. Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements match them well or that neither does. This is normal, but when it occurs very frequently, it does lead to less confidence in the accuracy of direction indicated by your report. Please keep this in mind when considering how well you feel your report describes you.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Many years of research conducted by The Gallup Organization suggest that the most effective people are those who understand their strengths and behaviour. These people are best able to develop strategies to meet and exceed the demands of their daily lives, their careers, and their families.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">A review of the knowledge and skills you have acquired can provide a basic sense of your abilities, but an awareness and understanding of your natural talents will provide true insight into the core reasons behind your consistent successes.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Your Signature Themes report presents your five most dominant themes of talent, in the ranking order revealed by your responses to StrengthsFinder. Of the 34 themes measured, these are your &quot;top five.&quot;</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Your Signature Themes are very important in maximising the talents that lead to your successes. By focussing on your Signature Themes, separately and in combination, you can identify your talents, build them into strengths, and enjoy personal and career success through consistent, near-perfect performance.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Deoarece multe dintre răspunsurile dvs. au fost în categoria Neutru sau nu au fost marcate, nu vă putem oferi un raport. Unii oameni nu pot alege o afirmaţie dintr-o pereche, deoarece simt fie că ambele afirmaţii li se potrivesc, fie că nici una dintre acestea nu li se potriveşte. Acest lucru este normal, dar dus la extrem, poate împiedica identificarea temelor predominante.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Reluaţi testul StrengthsFinder ţinând cont de cele de mai sus, pentru a vă calcula temele predominante.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Deoarece multe dintre răspunsurile dvs. au fost în categoria Neutru sau nu au fost marcate, se recomandă o doză de rezervă în interpretare: Unii oameni nu pot alege o afirmaţie dintr-o pereche, deoarece simt fie că ambele afirmaţii li se potrivesc, fie că nici una dintre acestea nu li se potriveşte. Acest lucru este normal, dar când se întâmplă foarte frecvent determină scăderea încrederii în acurateţea direcţiei indicate de raportul dvs. Reţineţi acest aspect atunci când evaluaţi modul în care consideraţi că sunteţi descris de raport.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT_SQ">Deoarece multe dintre răspunsurile dvs. au fost în categoria Neutru sau nu au fost marcate, se recomandă o doză de rezervă în interpretare: Unii oameni nu pot alege o afirmaţie dintr-o pereche, deoarece simt fie că ambele afirmaţii li se potrivesc, fie că nici una dintre acestea nu li se potriveşte.

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Anii de experienţă acumulaţi de The Gallup Organization în domeniul cercetării confirmă faptul că cei mai eficienţi oameni sunt cei care îşi cunosc punctele forte şi modul de a reacţiona în diverse situaţii. Aceşti oameni reuşesc să dezvolte strategii prin care îşi îndeplinesc şi chiar îşi depăşesc necesităţile vieţii personale, ale carierei şi familiei.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">O trecere în revistă a cunoştinţelor şi aptitudinilor dvs. vă poate oferi o imagine generală a abilităţilor dvs., dar numai înţelegerea profundă a punctelor dvs. forte vă va oferi o imagine clară şi corectă a motivelor care stau la baza succesului dvs.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Raportul Teme predominante vă va prezenta cele mai relevante domenii pentru care aveţi talent, în ordinea rezultată din răspunsurile dvs. la testul StrengthsFinder. Din cele 34 de teme măsurate, acestea sunt &quot;primele cinci&quot;.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Temele predominante sunt foarte importante în exploatarea eficientă a aptitudinilor care vă aduc succes. Concentrându-vă asupra temelor predominante, atât separat, cât şi în combinaţie, vă puteţi identifica talentele, le puteţi consolida în puncte forte şi vă puteţi bucura de succes în viaţa personală şi în carieră prin performanţe constante, aproape perfecte.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">På grund av att ett stort antal svar var inom den neutrala kategorin eller omarkerade kan vi inte tillhandahålla din rapport. Somliga kan inte välja ett påstående från ett givet par eftersom de antingen känner att båda påståendena stämmer eller att inget av dem stämmer. Det är normalt, men om det dras till sin ytterlighet kan det förhindra temats utbredning.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Tänk på detta när du gör om StrengthsFinder, så kommer dina signaturteman att beräknas.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Eftersom många av dina svar var antingen inom den neutrala kategorin eller omarkerade är en varning motiverad: Somliga kan inte välja ett påstående från ett givet par eftersom de antingen känner att båda påståendena stämmer eller att inget av dem stämmer. Det är normalt, men när det händer mycket ofta leder det till minskad tillförlitlighet för din rapport. Kom ihåg det när du överväger hur väl du tycker att din rapport beskriver dig.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT_SQ">Eftersom många av dina svar var inom den neutrala kategorin eller omarkerade genereras en varning: Somliga kan inte välja ett påstående från ett givet par eftersom de antingen känner att båda påståendena stämmer eller att inget av det stämmer. Det är normalt, men när det händer mycket ofta leder det till minskad tillförlitlighet för din rapport. Kom ihåg det när du överväger hur väl du tycker att din rapport beskriver dig.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Många års forskning som utförts av The Gallup Organization visar på att de mest effektiva personerna är dem som förstår sina styrkor och beteenden. De personerna kan bäst utveckla strategier för att tillgodose och överträffa sina behov i sina vardagsliv, sina karriärer och sina familjer.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">En granskning av den kunskap och de färdigheter du har uppnått kan ge en grundläggande känsla för dina förmågor, men en medvetenhet och förståelse för dina naturliga talanger ger en äkta insikt i de huvudsakliga orsakerna bakom dina konsekventa framgångar.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Din signaturtemarapport presenterar dina fem mest dominanta talangteman, i den rankningsordning som visas med hjälp av dina svar i StrengthsFinder. Av de 34 teman som har mätts var de här dina &quot;topp fem&quot;.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Dina signaturteman är mycket viktiga för att maximera de talanger som leder till dina framgångar. Genom att fokusera på dina signaturteman, både separat och i kombination, kan du identifiera dina talanger, utveckla dem till styrkor och uppnå både personliga och karriärmässiga framgångar genom en prestation som är jämn i kvaliteten och nära nog perfekt.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Тъй като голям брой от вашите отговори са в категорията &quot;Неутрални&quot; или не са отбелязани, ние не сме в състояние да ви предложим доклад. Някои хора не могат да изберат едно твърдение от предложена двойка, защото чувстват, че или и двете твърдения им съответстват добре, или нито едно от тях не им съответства. Това е нормално, но, когато е доведено до крайност, може да попречи на установяването на преобладаващите теми.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Попълнете отново StrengthsFinder, като имате това предвид, и Вашите ключови теми ще бъдат изчислени.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Тъй като много от вашите отговори са в категория &quot;Неутрални&quot; или немаркирани, необходимо е едно предупреждение: Някои хора не могат да изберат едно изявление от две, защото чувстват, че и двете им прилягат, или че нито едно от тях не им приляга. Това е нормално, но когато се случва често, води до по-малка сигурност в точността на насоките, указани от вашия доклад. Моля, имайте това предвид, когато оценявате колко добре ви описва вашият доклад.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">След много години на научни изследвания, проведени от Gallup Organization, е установено, че най-ефективни са хората, които разбират своите силни страни и начини на поведение. Тези хора най-добре могат да разработват стратегии, така че да посрещнат и надхвърлят изискванията на своя всекидневен живот, кариера и семейство.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Прегледът на знанията и уменията, които сте придобили, може да даде общо представа за вашите способности, но осъзнаването и разбирането на вашия природен талант ще ви даде истинско вдъхновение за същинските причини зад вашите последователни успехи.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Докладът &quot;Вашите ключови теми&quot; представя петте най-доминиращи теми от вашия талант, в реда, показан от вашите отговори в StrengthsFinder. От 34-те измерени теми, това е вашият &quot;топ пет&quot;.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">&quot;Вашите Ключови теми&quot; са много важни за максимизирането на таланта, водещ към вашите успехи. Чрез фокусиране върху вашите ключови теми - поотделно и в съчетание - вие можете да определите своя талант, да го превърнете в силни страни и да се радвате на успех в личния живот и кариерата, чрез последователно, почти идеално представяне.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">No podemos brindarle un informe debido a que una gran cantidad de sus respuestas se ubicaron en una categoría neutral o no se suministraron. Algunas personas no pueden elegir una frase en particular porque sienten que ambas, o ninguna, se aplican a su caso. Esto es aceptable, pero, llevado al extremo, puede impedir que se identifiquen los talentos dominantes.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Por favor, vuelva a realizar la evaluación de StrengthsFinder con esto en mente y se calcularán sus talentos dominantes.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Dado que muchas de sus respuestas se ubicaban en una categoría neutral o no se suministraron, es preciso realizar una advertencia: algunas personas encuentran dificultades para preferir una frase respecto de la otra porque sienten que ambas son adecuadas o porque creen que ninguna los representa. Si bien esto normal, cuando ocurre con mucha frecuencia, afecta la confianza en la precisión del rumbo indicado por su informe. No lo olvide a la hora de evaluar si el informe lo describe correctamente.</lin:text>

Si bien es normal, cuando ocurre con mucha frecuencia afecta la confianza en la exactitud del rumbo indicado por su informe.

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Las investigaciones realizadas durante muchos años por The Gallup Organization indican que las personas más eficaces son aquéllas que comprenden sus fortalezas y comportamientos. Estas personas se encuentran mejor capacitadas para desarrollar estrategias que satisfagan y superen las exigencias diarias de su vida, su profesión y su entorno familiar.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">El repaso de los conocimientos y las destrezas que ha adquirido puede brindarle una idea básica de sus capacidades; sin embargo, la percepción y la comprensión de sus talentos naturales le permitirán ver más claramente la principal razón de su éxito.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">En el informe de talentos dominantes se incluyen sus principales cinco talentos dominantes, ordenados de acuerdo con sus respuestas a StrengthsFinder. De los 34 talentos medidos, éstos son los cinco principales.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Sus talentos dominantes son muy importantes para maximizar aquellos talentos que le permiten lograr el éxito. Concentrarse en sus talentos dominantes, ya sea de forma aislada o en conjunto, le permitirá identificar sus talentos, transformarlos en fortalezas, y disfrutar del éxito personal y profesional a través de un desempeño uniforme y casi perfecto.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Como seleccionó en un gran número de respuestas la categoría Neutra o no respondió, no podemos suministrarle su informe. Algunas personas no pueden elegir una frase de un par determinado porque estiman o que ambas frases son apropiadas para ellas o que ninguna lo es. Esto es normal, pero llevado al extremo, puede impedir la identificación de los talentos predominantes.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Vuelva a hacer el cuestionario de StrengthsFinder teniendo esto en cuenta, y se calcularán sus talentos más destacados.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Debido a que en muchas de sus respuestas usted seleccionó la categoría Neutra o no respondió, es preciso realizar una advertencia: algunas personas no pueden elegir entre las dos frases de un par porque estiman o que ambas frases son apropiadas para ellas o que ninguna lo es. Esto es normal, pero cuando sucede con mucha frecuencia, hace que las indicaciones de su informe resulten menos fiables. Por favor, tenga esto presente a la hora de considerar hasta qué punto su informe le describe correctamente.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT_SQ">Debido a que en muchas de sus respuestas usted seleccionó la categoría Neutra o no respondió, es preciso realizar una advertencia: algunas personas no pueden elegir entre las dos frases de un par porque estiman o que ambas frases son apropiadas para ellas o que ninguna lo es. Esto es normal, pero cuando sucede con mucha frecuencia, hace que las indicaciones de su informe resulten menos fiables. Por favor, tenga esto presente a la hora de considerar hasta qué punto su informe le describe correctamente.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Los resultados de las investigaciones realizadas por The Gallup Organization a lo largo de los años indican que las personas más eficaces son aquellas que mejor conocen sus puntos fuertes y su comportamiento. Estas personas son quienes mejor pueden desarrollar estrategias para satisfacer y superar las exigencias de sus vidas cotidianas, sus profesiones y sus familias.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Hacer un repaso de los conocimientos y aptitudes que usted ha adquirido puede darle una idea general de sus capacidades, pero entender sus talentos innatos y ser consciente de ellos le proporcionará una auténtica comprensión de los motivos básicos en los que se basa su éxito a lo largo del tiempo.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">El informe sobre sus talentos más destacados presenta sus cinco talentos predominantes, en el orden establecido por las respuestas de su StrengthsFinder. De los 34 talentos medidos, éstos son sus &quot;cinco dominantes&quot;.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Sus talentos más destacados son muy importantes para maximizar las aptitudes que le llevarán al éxito. Al centrar la atención en sus talentos más destacados, por separado y en conjunto, usted puede identificar sus aptitudes, convertirlas en puntos fuertes y disfrutar del éxito personal y profesional mediante un rendimiento constante y casi perfecto.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Wij kunnen uw rapport niet genereren omdat een groot aantal antwoorden zich in de neutrale categorie bevindt of niet is gegeven. Sommige mensen kunnen geen keuze maken uit een van de twee stellingen omdat zij vinden dat allebei de stellingen op hun van toepassing zijn of juist niet. Dit is normaal, maar als het heel vaak voorkomt, kan het de bepaling van de dominante thema's onmogelijk maken.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Houd dit in gedachten als u de StrengthsFinder opnieuw doet, uw kenmerkende thema's worden dan berekend.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Omdat een groot aantal van uw antwoorden zich in de neutrale categorie bevindt of niet is gegeven, is een waarschuwing op zijn plaats: sommige mensen zijn niet in staat een keuze te maken, omdat ze het idee hebben dat beide stellingen hen goed beschrijven of dat geen van beide hen goed beschrijft. Dit is normaal, maar als het vaak voorkomt, kunnen we minder vertrouwen hechten aan de juistheid van de kenmerken vermeld in het rapport. Houd dit in gedachten als u beoordeelt of de beschrijving in het rapport herkenbaar is.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Uit jarenlang onderzoek uitgevoerd door The Gallup Organization is gebleken dat de mensen die het meest doeltreffend zijn, degenen zijn die weten wat hun sterke punten zijn. Deze mensen zijn het best in staat om strategieën te ontwikkelen waarmee ze kunnen voldoen aan de eisen van hun dagelijks leven, werk en gezinsleven.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Een overzicht van de kennis en vaardigheden die u hebt verworven kan een indruk geven van uw capaciteiten, maar pas als u zich bewust bent van uw natuurlijke talenten en deze begrijpt, zult u weten wat er aan de basis ligt van uw successen.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Het rapport met uw kenmerkende thema's vermeldt de talentthema's die bij u het sterkste zijn, in de volgorde die kan worden afgeleid uit uw antwoorden op StrengthsFinder. Van de 34 gemeten thema's is dit uw 'top vijf'.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Uw kenmerkende thema's zijn van groot belang als u de talenten die leiden tot succes wilt optimaliseren. Door u te richten op uw kenmerkende thema's, afzonderlijk en in combinatie, kunt u bepalen wat uw talenten zijn, deze omvormen tot sterke punten en succes boeken in uw persoonlijk leven en op het werk door consistente, bijna perfecte prestaties.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Vous n'avez pas répondu ou émis d'avis pour un trop grand nombre de questions. Il nous est dès lors impossible de fournir votre rapport. Certaines personnes ne peuvent faire leur choix entre deux affirmations données, car elles ont le sentiment que les deux phrases leur correspondent soit tout à fait, soit pas du tout. C'est une réaction normale, mais poussée à l'extrême, elle peut empêcher l'identification des thèmes dominants.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Vous n'avez pas répondu ou émis d'avis pour un trop grand nombre de questions ; il en résulte qu'une note d'avertissement a été émise. Certaines personnes sont incapables de choisir l'un des énoncés d'une paire donnée, soit parce qu'elles ont le sentiment que les deux énoncés leur correspondent parfaitement, soit parce qu'elles ont le sentiment qu'aucun des deux ne leur correspond. Il s'agit là d'un cas de figure normal, mais s'il intervient trop fréquemment, il entraînera toutefois une moindre fiabilité de la précision des indications figurant dans le rapport. Vous devrez prendre ce paramètre en compte lorsque vous vous pencherez sur la question de savoir dans quelle mesure votre rapport vous décrit de manière adéquate.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Da Sie bei sehr vielen Aussagenpaaren mit „Weder noch“ oder gar nicht geantwortet haben, können wir für Sie leider keinen Bericht erstellen. Es kann vorkommen, dass Personen sich für keine Aussage eines Paares entscheiden können, weil sie das Gefühl haben, dass entweder beide Aussagen auf sie zutreffen oder keine der beiden Aussagen zutrifft. Obwohl dies durchaus normal ist, können bei extrem häufigem Auftreten keine vorherrschenden Talente bestimmt werden.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Bitte denken Sie daran, wenn Sie erneut am StrengthsFinder teilnehmen. Ihre Talentschwerpunkte werden dann ebenfalls berücksichtigt.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Da Sie bei vielen Aussagenpaaren mit „Weder noch“ oder gar nicht geantwortet haben, sollten Sie folgenden Hinweis berücksichtigen: Manche Teilnehmer können bei einem Aussagenpaar keine Auswahl treffen, weil sie der Meinung sind, dass entweder beide oder gar keine der Aussagen auf sie zutreffen. Dies ist zwar durchaus normal, kann jedoch bei häufigem Auftreten dazu führen, dass die Genauigkeit der in dem Bericht enthaltenen Ergebnisse beeinträchtigt wird. Bitte berücksichtigen Sie diesen Gesichtspunkt, wenn Sie beurteilen, inwieweit Ihr Bericht auf Sie zutrifft.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Langjährige Forschungen von The Gallup Organization deuten darauf hin, dass jene Personen zu den leistungsstärksten zählen, die ihre eigenen Stärken und Verhaltensmuster verstehen. Diese Personen zeigen sich am fähigsten, wenn es darum geht, die Anforderungen des täglichen Lebens, ihres Berufs und ihrer Familie zu erfüllen und zu übertreffen.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Anhand Ihres erworbenen Wissens und erworbener Fähigkeiten kann eine grundlegende Aussage über Ihre Fähigkeiten getroffen werden. Doch erst das Bewusstsein und Verständnis Ihrer natürlichen Begabungen und Fähigkeiten ermöglicht einen echten Einblick in die wahren Gründe für Ihren anhaltenden Erfolg.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Im Bericht zu Ihren Talentschwerpunkten sind Ihre fünf wichtigsten Talente in der Reihenfolge aufgeführt, die sich aus Ihren Antworten im StrengthsFinder ergeben hat. Von den 34 Talentschwerpunkten, die beurteilt wurden, sind diese fünf bei Ihnen am ausgeprägtesten.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Ihre Talentschwerpunkte sind zur maximalen Ausschöpfung Ihrer Talente, die zur Verwirklichung Ihrer Erfolge führen, sehr wichtig. Wenn Sie sich auf jeden Ihrer persönlichen Talentschwerpunkte oder auf alle fünf zusammen konzentrieren, können Sie Ihre Talente erkennen, diese in Stärken verwandeln und durch gleich bleibende, nahezu perfekte Leistungen persönlichen und beruflichen Erfolg genießen. </lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Mivel túl sok válasza a Semleges kategóriába esett, vagy nem jelölt be választ, nem tudjuk elvégezni a kiértékelést. Vannak, akik képtelenek választani egy adott állításpárból, mert úgy érzik, mindkét megállapítás jellemzi őket, vagy egyik sem illik rájuk. Ez érthető, de szélsőséges esetben megakadályozhatja a jellemző témakörök azonosítását.</lin:text>

Vannak, akik képtelenek választani egy adott állításpárból, mert úgy érzik, mindkét megállapítás jellemzi őket, vagy egyik sem illik rájuk. Ez természetes, de ha gyakran előfordul, csökkenti a jelentésben kiemelt irányultság megbízhatóságát. Kérjük, tartsa ezt szem előtt, amikor azt értékeli, mennyire illik Önre a jellemzés.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">A The Gallup Organization sokéves kutatási eredményei azt mutatják, hogy valószínűleg azok az emberek képesek igazi hatékonyságra, akik tisztában vannak saját adottságaikkal és viselkedésükkel. Ők alkalmasak leginkább olyan stratégiák kidolgozására, amelyekkel mindennapjaikban, munkájukban és családi életükben helyt tudnak állni, vagy akár messze meghaladhatják az elvárásokat.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">A szerzett tudás és a készségek vizsgálata alapján is körvonalazhatók az adottságok, ám csak a velünk született tehetség tudatos feltárásával és megértésével lehet valódi képet alkotni arról, alapvetően milyen erők állnak az ismétlődő sikerek hátterében.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">A meghatározó adottságokat összefoglaló jelentés felsorolja a válaszadó öt legfontosabb erősségét a StrengthsFinder kérdésekre adott válaszok alapján kialakult sorrendben. A 34 mért témakör közül ez az Ön öt legfontosabb témaköre.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">A meghatározó adottságok ismerete rendkívül fontos a sikerhez vezető képességek maximális kibontakoztatás a érdekében. Ha külön-külön vagy együttesen a meghatározó adottságaira összpontosít, azonosíthatja adottságait, azokat erősségekké alakíthatja, és élvezheti a személyes és szakmai sikereket a folyamatos, közel tökéletes teljesítmény révén.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Dal momento che molte delle Sue risposte rientrano nella categoria Neutro oppure sono state lasciate in bianco, non siamo in grado di fornirLe alcun report. Alcuni non riescono a scegliere tra due dichiarazioni in quanto si sentono rappresentati adeguatamente da entrambe oppure da nessuna delle due. Tutto ciò è normale, ma se eccessivamente frequente può impedire l'identificazione dei Temi principali.</lin:text>

Tutto ciò è normale, ma se avviene molto frequentemente, può diminuire la precisione delle indicazioni riportate dal report. Ricordi questa avvertenza al momento di valutare quanto si sente rispecchiato dal Suo report personale.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Anni di ricerche condotte da The Gallup Organization suggeriscono che le persone più efficienti sono quelle che capiscono i propri punti di forza e i propri comportamenti. Queste persone sono le migliori quando si tratta di sviluppare strategie capaci di soddisfare e andare oltre le aspettative che si trovano a sostenere nel corso della loro vita quotidiana, professionale e familiare.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Una verifica delle competenze e delle capacità che ha acquisito può darLe il polso delle Sue abilità, ma la consapevolezza e la comprensione dei Suoi talenti naturali Le consentiranno di esplorare a fondo le ragioni che sono alla base dei Suoi successi.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Il report relativo ai Suoi Temi principali presenta i Suoi talenti più spiccati secondo l'ordine derivato dalle Sue risposte a StrengthsFinder. Tra i 34 temi valutati, questi rappresentano la Sua &quot;top five&quot;.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">I Suoi Temi principali sono molto importanti per riuscire a perfezionare quei talenti che possono portarLa verso il successo. Concentrandosi sui Suoi Temi principali, singolarmente e complessivamente, potrà identificare i Suoi talenti, trasformarli in punti di forza e raggiungere il successo personale e lavorativo grazie a prestazioni continuative e vicine alla perfezione.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">대표 테마 보고서에는 StrengthsFinder에서 응답하여 드러난 순위에 따라 가장 우세한 5가지의 소질에 대한 테마가 표시됩니다. 이는 측정된 34개의 테마 중 &quot;상위 테마 5개&quot;에 해당됩니다.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Ponieważ wiele udzielonych odpowiedzi należało do kategorii „neutralne” lub pozostało niezaznaczonych, nie można utworzyć zestawienia. Niektóre osoby nie potrafią wybrać jednego stwierdzenia z podanej pary, ponieważ czują, że obydwa pasują do nich w tym samym stopniu albo nie opisują ich wcale. Jest to zjawisko normalne, ale w skrajnym przypadku może uniemożliwić identyfikację głównych cech.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL_RETAKE">Biorąc ten fakt pod uwagę, należy ponownie powtórzyć badanie StrengthsFinder, aby obliczyć Główne Cechy.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Z powodu dużej liczby odpowiedzi z kategorii „neutralne” lub braku odpowiedzi konieczne jest podanie przez nas poniższego ostrzeżenia: Niektóre osoby nie potrafią wybrać żadnego stwierdzenia z podanej pary zdań, ponieważ czują, że obydwa stwierdzenia pasują do nich w tym samym stopniu albo nie opisują ich wcale. Jest to zjawisko normalne, ale jeśli zdarza się bardzo często, prowadzi do obniżenia poziomu zaufania w odniesieniu do dokładności wyników zawartych w zestawieniu. Proszę mieć to na uwadze, zastanawiając się, na ile trafne jest niniejsze zestawienie.</lin:text>

Są one w największym stopniu zdolne do opracowywania strategii pomagających im w spełnianiu lub przekroczeniu wymagań życia codziennego, zawodowego i rodzinnego.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Przegląd zdobytej wiedzy i umiejętności może dostarczyć podstawowej orientacji, co do posiadanych możliwości, ale prawdziwe zrozumienie przyczyn sukcesu i osiągnięć można uzyskać dopiero dzięki zrozumieniu swoich wrodzonych uzdolnień.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Zestawienie „Twoje Główne Cechy” przedstawia pięć dominujących cech charakteru uporządkowanych w kolejności wynikającej z odpowiedzi udzielonych w badaniu StrengthsFinder™. Jest to pięć najważniejszych cech spośród 34 mierzonych.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Znajomość głównych cech jest szczególnie ważna w aspekcie maksymalnego wykorzystania posiadanych uzdolnień w celu odnoszenia sukcesów. Koncentrując się na swoich głównych cechach, na każdej oddzielnie oraz na ich kombinacji, można zidentyfikować swoje uzdolnienia, rozwijać je w mocne strony i osiągać sukcesy osobiste i zawodowe, dzięki ich konsekwentnemu i skutecznemu wykorzystywaniu.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Because a great number of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, we are unable to provide your report.  Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements fit them well or that neither does. This is normal, but taken to an extreme it can prevent identification of theme prevalence.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="INSUFFICIENT">Because many of your responses were in the Neutral category or unmarked, a note of caution is warranted: Some people are unable to choose one statement from a given pair because they feel either that both statements fit them well or that neither does. This is normal, but when it occurs very frequently, it does lead to less confidence in the accuracy of direction indicated by your report.  Please keep this in mind when considering how well you feel your report describes you.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">Many years of research conducted by The Gallup Organization suggest that the most effective people are those who understand their strengths and behaviors.  These people are best able to develop strategies to meet and exceed the demands of their daily lives, their careers, and their families.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">A review of the knowledge and skills you have acquired can provide a basic sense of your abilities, but an awareness and understanding of your natural talents will provide true insight into the core reasons behind your consistent successes.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Your Signature Themes report presents your five most dominant themes of talent, in the rank order revealed by your responses to StrengthsFinder.  Of the 34 themes measured, these are your "top five."</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Your Signature Themes are very important in maximizing the talents that lead to your successes.  By focusing on your Signature Themes, separately and in combination, you can identify your talents, build them into strengths, and enjoy personal and career success through consistent, near-perfect performance.</lin:text>

		<lin:text id="COMPLETELY_NEUTRAL">Yanıtlarınızın bir çoğunun Nötr kategorisinde olması ya da işaretlenmemiş olması nedeniyle, raporunuzu sunamamaktayız. Bazı insanlar, her iki ifadenin de kendilerine çok iyi uyduğunu ya da ikisinin de uymadığını düşünerek, verilen ifade çiftlerden birini seçmezler. Bu normaldir ancak aşırıya kaçılması durumunda, özelliklerin tekrarlanma sıklığının tespit edilmesini engelleyebilir.</lin:text>

Bu durum normaldir ancak çok sık meydana geldiğinde, raporunuzun belirttiği yönün doğruluğuna daha az güvenilmesine yol açar.

		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_1">The Gallup Organization'ın uzun yıllar süren çalışmaları, en etkili insanların, güçlü yönlerini ve davranışlarını bilen insanlar olduğunu öne sürmektedir. Bu insanlar, günlük yaşantılarının, kariyerlerinin ve ailelerinin taleplerini karşılayabilmek ve bunların ötesine geçebilmek için stratejiler geliştirebilme konusunda çok iyidir.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_2">Edindiğiniz bilgi ve becerilerin gözden geçirilmesi, yeteneklerinizin temel anlamda bilincine varmanızı sağlayacaktır; ancak doğal kabiliyetlerinizin farkında olmanız ve bunları anlamanız, süreli başarınızın ardında yatan temel nedenleri gerçekten görebilmenizi sağlayacaktır.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_3">Baskın Özellikler raporunuz, StrenghtsFinder'a vermiş olduğunuz yanıtların ortaya çıkardığı sıraya göre, en dominant beş yeteneğinizi yansıtmaktadır. Ölçülen 34 özellik arasından, &quot;ilk beş&quot; özelliğiniz bunlar.</lin:text>
		<lin:text id="NORMAL_REPORT_4">Baskın Özellikleriniz, sizi başarıya götüren yeteneklerinizin artırılması açısından çok önemlidir. Baskın Özelliklerinize ayrı ayrı ve birlikte odaklanarak, yeteneklerinizi tespit edebilir, bunları güçlü yönleriniz haline getirebilir ve sürekli, mükemmele yakın bir performansla kişisel ve kariyer becerilerinizin keyfine varabilirsiniz.</lin:text>
